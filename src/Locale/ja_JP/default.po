msgstr "コードの例を書くときには、いつでもCakePHPの規約やコーディング基準に沿うように努め、その例がエラーを投げたり、誤った結果を出したりしないか確かめてください。これは良い方法を広め、開発者が大きな遠回りをせずに既定で「正しい方法」で学ぶ手助けになります。"

This helps keep the links and references to the framework consistent. For example, CAKEPHP, Cakephp, cake-php or just Cake would be incorrect uses. Maintaining a common spelling and format for the name helps keep brand coherent and consistent."
msgstr "CakePHPという名前を正しく使うように努めてください。この名前は「CakePHP」と綴られるべきで、これで一語であり、大文字の「C」、そして「PHP」です。これはフレームワークへの一貫したリンクや参照に一貫性を保つのを助けます。例えば、CAKEPHP、Cakephp、cake-php、またはただのCakeは正しくない使用しれません。名前を一般的な綴りや書式を維持することは、ブランドのまとまりや一貫性を保つのを助けます。"

#: Template/Element/get-involved/community-guidelines.ctp:17
msgid "When making a reference to CakePHP in a marketing or promotional context, it helps to make the name stand-out or interactive. Consider using &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;b&gt; tags for HTML, bold formatting for documents, or making the name a visible link to {0}. Don't overuse the name in any body of text, instead try keeping any direct uses of the name relevant. To even out the usage try to use other references, such as \"the framework\" or \"the project\"."
msgstr "マーケティングや販促の文脈でCakePHPを参照するとき、それはその名前を目立たせ、相互作用になるのを助けます。HTMLで &lt;strong&gt; や &lt;b&gt; タグ使用して文書中で太字にしたり、あるいはその名前で{0}にリンクすることを考えてみてください。本文の中で過度に使用せず、関係のある名前を直接使用するように努めてください。使用を調整するために「このフレームワーク」や「このプロジェクト」といった他の言及の仕方を考えてみてください。"

msgid "A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of words, phrases, symbols or designs, that\n\t\tidentifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A service mark is the\n\t\tsame as a trademark, except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product.\n\t\t\"Trade dress\" or \"get up\" refers to the look and feel of the packaging, which in this context can include the\n\t\tlayout, colors, images, and design choices in a web page. Throughout this Policy, the terms \"trademark\" and\n\t\t\"mark\" refer to both trademarks, service marks and trade dress."

For example, if the \"Foo\" software extension removes all double\n\t\tspaces after periods, but someone else later creates \"Foo\" software that adds a third space after periods,\n\t\tconsumers would be confused between the two and the newcomer will likely be a trademark infringer. As another\n\t\texample, if a company makes \"Foobar\" software and a third party offers training called \"Foobar Certification,\" a\n\t\tperson is likely to believe, wrongly, that the certification is being offered by the makers of Foobar software.\n\t\tThe third party has likely misled consumers about the source of its training and is a trademark infringer."
