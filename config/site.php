The 3rd virtual CakePHP Community meetup is coming up!

We're using topics from the previous meetup, and we'll be spicing them with some typical use cases in real applications:

## Topics

- Xdebug configuration
- Dev environment setup using vagrant, docker
- Queue plugin
- Reactphp configuration and usage
- STI Alternative mysql plugin

The topics and contents will be open to changes, and also open to contributions from attendees. We'll have some time for lightning talks to present about an idea/project/technology that you think it'll be useful for the community.

Please note the meeting will be hosted through RingCentral webinars, you'll be prompted to download the RingCentral client, so it might be wise to join 10 minutes before the event starts to test your audio etc.
We will share the link here prior to the event.

Note: This time Japan and other countries more eastern should also have a chance, so we need to do it a bit earlier for us.

        We didn't have a meetup for a while here in Berlin, and I think now with more and more
        events
        moving
        to online-only, it is time to set up a gathering again for our community.
        And since this is now fully online, why not inviting everyone of the (Cake)PHP coding community
        out
        there?

        ### Save the data

        We will give you the details shortly.
        If you want to co-host or add yourself as a speaker, please reach out with your topic.

        Main topics so far:
        - CakePHP 4.1 preview
        - IdeHelper / IDE usability and development speedup tips.
        - Auth with Authentication plugin
        - Fixture Factories

        ### Time-Schedule
        We want to do it 7PM Berlin time (GMT+2), so folks e.g. in the USA can join in still in the
        late
        morning.
        And the ones more east, should still also be able to join in, as well.

        Note: Event in English.",
